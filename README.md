# This is my coding challenge diary

## As a coder it can be easy to fall into the same old tricks but having a daily practice can make you more flexible and smarter.  If you can code everyday you are bound to become a master. Follow the daily challenge I am trying each day here. Feel to copy this README and do them with me. 
## I will be tracking my coding challenge solutions here day by day. Obiviously there are many ways to solve these challenges, so don't just accept my solutions as the best solution. If you have better solution I'd love to know.

# Day 1 

## 100 doors
### There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed. You make 100 passes by the doors. The first time through, visit every door and 'toggle' the door (if the door is closed, open it; if it is open, close it). The second time, only visit every 2nd door (i.e., door #2, #4, #6, ...) and toggle it. The third time, visit every 3rd door (i.e., door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc., until you only visit the 100th door.

### Implement a function to determine the state of the doors after the last pass. Return the final result in an array, with only the door number included in the array if it is open.

Expected ouput at 100 doors.
```
[ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 ]
```
